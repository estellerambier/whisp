***whisp*** stands for **WH**at **IS** in that **P**lot ? 

The Forest Data Partnership promotes a Convergence of Proof approach for Forest and Commodities Monitoring  

- no single source of geospatial data (i.e a land cover map) can tell the whole story around any given plot of land, 
- all the existing, published and available datasets contribute to telling that story 

***whisp***  implements that convergence approach by providing a transparent and public processing flow using those datasets

### whisp pathways
***whisp*** can be implemented through at least three pathways

1. As an operationnal API in JS and Python

2. Through mobile applications to enable smallholder in the field directly generate and own the monitoring data associated with their plots of land

3. Integrated through Graphical User Interfaces for demonstration and verification purposes
